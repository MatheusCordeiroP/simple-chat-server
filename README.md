# Simple Chat Server

Simple Chat Server is an app that allows users to join rooms and talk in real time.

There's no integration with database, and it was made based in another project with the purpose of learning more about sockets.

## Installation

Use the package manager [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) to install.

First, run yarn to get the project's packages.

```bash
yarn
```

Then, run yarn start to open the project.

```bash
yarn start
```

## Usage

Once running, the project will print on terminal the port being used, like this:

```
Server running on port 3000
```

Open the browser and write the link below, changing 3000 with the number that shows on your terminal at port.

```
localhost:3000/
```

Now you just need to write a username, choose a room, and enter the chat, you can open a new window to add more users and test, or host the app to talk with anyone.
